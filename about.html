            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Hello, I'm Jonathan Alvarado. I have been living in the beautiful island of Siquijor in the Philippines. I have always had a passion for creativity, especially in the realm of video and photo editing. Since high school, I have been honing my skills in editing videos, photos, and even music.
              </p>
              <p>
                In pursuit of my passion, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program and successfully completed my first year. However, my journey doesn't stop there. I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a deep interest in computers and a commitment to continuous learning, I am dedicated to exploring the ever-evolving world of video and photo editing. Additionally, I am currently expanding my skills in web development, studying the art of crafting engaging and interactive websites. I strive to combine my expertise in video and photo editing with my growing knowledge of web development to create visually stunning and user-friendly online experiences. I am excited to apply my creativity and technical skills to both realms, bringing captivating visuals and seamless functionality to the digital world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from my professional pursuits, I also enjoy playing online games as a pastime activity. In fact, I have a Facebook gaming page called <a href="http://fb.gg/joensalgaming" target="_blank">Jo Ensal</a>. I invite you to check it out and join me on my gaming adventures.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have any further questions or would like to know more about my work and experiences, feel free to reach out. I am always eager to connect and collaborate.
